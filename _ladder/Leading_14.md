- paves the way for the next leaders
- provides leadership opportunities for others
- takes risks making decisions
- fails and gets up and keeps going
- succeeds and shares the success with the rest of the team
- leads by actions and not just by words

- track record of building successful teams
- formalizing (summarizing) progress in reports for management
- together with the team members, set concrete self-development goals (for the team members) so that leadership is consistent and verifiable (regular one-to-one meetings where the team member can express their concerns, desires, and joys)
- Insights are genuinely brilliant because they fully support the definition of success for the project, find a balance between costs and benefits for everyone involved, and are the kinds of ideas that just make sense.
