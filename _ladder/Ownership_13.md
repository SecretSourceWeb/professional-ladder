Someone who understands what ownership of a project really means - it does not mean working long hours, but understanding the business goals of the project and the client. This person will not only feel confident to push back on ideas and offer their opinion but also suggest new ideas and look at the project from a business perspective rather than just the task/s at hand. Typically the client will want to have long conversations with this person to bounce ideas, flesh out ideas they have in their head and discuss viability of potential ideas they have. The client will feel that this person fully understands WHY they are doing the project and will see them as a partner rather than a developer.

- Is driven by client goals and will proactively suggest improvements rather than just doing as instructed
