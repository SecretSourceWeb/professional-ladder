Fully owns a project (consisting of multiple developers)
- (Always) Identifies who will work on the project and what they will do. This could be the result of consensus or a decision by a single person
- Is (always) reponsible for QA on the project (which means you will choose the QA processes that will be followed and will make sure the process get followed, that the code passes QA)
- Communicates regularly with the PM / Client on project progress and risks
- Anticipates potential issues with the code or solution and plans work accordingly (ex.: internal IT department of client has to approve everything. In response, estimates include extra time for fixing issues spotted by Sonar reports. Ex: Client states they do not need to rank well in Google. In response, we still follow best practices and estimate and price accordingly so that 6 months down the road when Google does matter, the work is already done.
