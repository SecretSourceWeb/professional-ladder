- Track record of task and small project ownership
- Is aware of client needs and goals and adapts accordingly
- they know at all times how the client has defined success and if not will ask. They will also use that definition to drive how they work and be constantly challenging decisions if they do not reflect how they understand success. The typical quality vs time conundrum. They will also communicate this clearly to the client ... if you need this by Friday I can only do it this way ... this means that in future ... at any time the developer can explain how success has been defined, will question it and the way they work will be defined by it.
- At this level developers are reliable. They do what they say they'll do (but may still be off on estimates). For example, if they say they'll get back to you, they get back to you. If they receive an email directed at them, they reply within a reasonable amount of time.
- At this level developers are able to rephrase tasks and ideas in their own words to demonstrate their understanding (or lack of) of a given task. For example, if a user story is "I as a user can leave a comment on a post so that my voice can be heard by the community." the developer might rephrase as "Add a feature that allows users to comment on posts. This implies creating a Comment object and a relationship to both Posts and Users." and might follow up with a question: "Should comments be deleted when the Post or User is deleted?"
- Demonstrates curiosity by asking about issues that are not assigned to her but that are of interest, possibly because they could impact her work.
