    skill: Ownership
    level: 10
---
- Owns their own tasks without guidance: Ownership = responsible for estimation, planning, quality, and executing
- Asks product owner for clarification, perhaps with hesitation, prior to starting to program, when requirements are unclear.
- Asks for help from supervisor or other developers when unsure about how to proceed. However, prior to asking for help, does some research into what the problem and potential solutions are and summarizes the issue prior to interrupting others.
- Participates in sprint planning, providing input on both scope and priority as they understand it at this level and time in their career. For example, if the dev perceives the priority of tasks to be incorrect, she will suggest a new prioritization for a reason.
